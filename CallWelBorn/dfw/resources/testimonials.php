				<p class="quotes">Fantastic Service from the get go! We had several companies come out to service/quote our Ac unit and check out a problem with cooling our upstairs. By far, Weeks had superior service compared to the others! Our service tech Vic, arrived in a Weeks marked truck and was very courteous looking like he worked for a reputable business. Two other companies came out to give us a quote and showed up in unmarked cars with the appearance they were not with a company. I appreciated how Weeks wore the uniform…helped with my comfort. Our tech did a thorough inspection spending time explaining everything he was doing and what we needed to know. Unlike the other two companies, Weeks was able to take the time and problem solve. He walked us through and showed us what could be the issue with our unit in the attic. Afterwards, he gave us another thorough breakdown of cost and parts needed. We felt very pleased with the service and appreciated the attention they gave to us answering all of our questions! Excellent service! </p>

				<p class="quotes">Great service! Had an air conditioner problem on a weekend and couldn't get much help from the few places you can call on the weekend. Contacted Weeks on Saturday morning and they got a technician out to me in the rain in less than three hours! Vanessa took my call and she was very helpful and friendly. I appreciate her calling me and letting me know that the technician was on the way. Matt was great and worked miracles on my old air conditioner. He was very friendly and worked out several problems. He was very patient with all of my questions. Thanks for working miracles Matt! I will definitely call Weeks first next time. It is great to support a good local company!</p>

				<p class="quotes">I would highly recommend Weeks. They are very knowledgeable, professional, prompt service as well and give one on one personal service. Weeks has serviced our current home since 2012 when they installed a new unit. We also have the service contract, which I would also recommend. Each time a technician comes they are each very professional and polite. I would especially like to recognize Anthony, he is very thorough in his inspection and paperwork, very polite, professional and gives helpful information when needed. He is to be commended for a job more than well done.</p>

				<p class="quotes">I have been using Weeks A.C. service for many years now. They installed a complete AC/Heater system in my League City home a few years ago and I was pleased with the professional craftsmanship their technicians displayed. They also offered follow-ups in the years to follow to ensure that our unit ran without incident. Recently I had Weeks service over to evaluate the AC at my Galveston condominium. The technician (Aaron) was courteous and very informative. He took the time to explain issues I had with my unit and offered several options for me. For Honest Reliable HVAC service, I recommend Weeks Service Company. </p>
