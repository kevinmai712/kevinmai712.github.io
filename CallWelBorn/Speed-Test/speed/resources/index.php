		<h2>Our Promise to You</h2>
		<p>With over four decades of experience in the heating and cooling industry, you can feel confident in our technicians to get the job done right the first time. When you choose to work with our professional, competent and qualified team, you’re choosing reliability and unmatched workmanship. Here is what you can expect from <?php echo $company_name;?>:</p>

		<ul>
		<li><b>Trusted Technicians:</b> Your safety is important to us. That’s why we don’t hire technicians we wouldn’t invite into our own home. Our technicians must pass a full background check as well as routine drug tests. We hold our team to stringent standards so that we can deliver excellence to every single customer, residential or commercial.</li>

		<li><b>Live Call Center:</b> Technology has done a lot of good for our society, but it has also done a lot of bad, particularly in the context of customer service. Tired of reaching automated messages? We don’t blame you. Since we truly care about establishing lasting relationships with all our customers, we have a live call center. When you call to schedule an appointment, you will be greeted by a real person, not a machine, whose top priority is making sure your needs are met.</li>

		<li><b>Red Carpet Service:</b> We understand that your home is one of your most beloved possessions. Upon arriving at your home, your service technician will place down carpets and put on shoe coverings to protect your floors. Once the job is complete and you are satisfied with the result, they will clean up any messes.</li></ul>

		<p>At <?php echo $company_name;?>, we take pride in the experience we provide for our customers as well as in the level of work we complete. That’s why we back our work with guarantees. If you are not 100% satisfied with your service experience, whether it’s because your technician smoked, smelled of alcohol, swore or wasn’t drug-free, we will refund your payment in full. Further, our We Fix It or It’s Free Guarantee means if we don’t fix the problem correctly the first time, the repair is free. If a repair falls under our warranty, we will return and fix it at no cost to you.</p>
		<p>Our technicians are among the best in the industry. We require them to complete ongoing training to remain up to date on the latest technology and industry practices. Get quick relief and sustained peace of mind by calling our office today! We guarantee on-time service.</p>
