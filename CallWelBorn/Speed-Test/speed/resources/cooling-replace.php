		<h1>Trusted Air Conditioning Installation & Replacement</h1>
		<h2>Maximize home comfort with a brand-new system.</h2>

		<p>The reliable air conditioning installation experts at <?php echo $company_name;?> can help you choose the perfect system for your Galveston or Houston home. When you combine our extensive knowledge surrounding air conditioning equipment with our good old-fashioned service, what you get is quality care at a more than fair price. Save money and keep comfortable all summer long by calling our office today!</p>

		<p>Before we replace your system outright, we will first complete a comprehensive inspection to see if you’re better off having it repaired instead. We truly seek to provide our customers with solutions they can trust. That is why we will not insist on replacing your system if it is not necessary.</p>

		<h2>Signs Your A/C Needs to be Replaced:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Old Age (10-15 years)</li>
			<li>High Energy Bills</li>
			<li>Frequent Repairs</li>
			<li>Uneven Temperatures</li></ul>

		<p>When you need to replace your air conditioning system, always enlist the help of a licensed, skilled and trusted technician. Attempting to replace the system yourself puts you at risk for completing an improper installation, which will lead to further repairs, not to mention it can cause your energy bill to sky rocket. </p>

		<p>Don’t hire just any HVAC company to install your new system. By enlisting the help of our honest and more than qualified technicians, you can rest easy knowing you will be cared for every step of the way. Our method of doing business is treating customers with respect and making sure they are more than satisfied with their experience. Our We Fix It or It’s Free Guarantee means we get the job done right the very first time, or the repair is free!</p>
