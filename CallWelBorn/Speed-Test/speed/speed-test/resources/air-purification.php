		<h1>Effective Air Purification Systems </h1>
		<h2>Eliminate harmful indoor air pollutants with our purification systems.</h2>

		<p>The air inside your home should be clean and safe. Recent studies indicate that indoor air can be five to ten, and occasionally 100, times more polluted than outdoor air. Because the air you breathe in directly affects your health, it’s important not to take these findings lightly. Protect yourself and your loved ones with our highly-effective indoor air quality solutions.</p>

		<p>We offer numerous air purifying options so that we can fit your specific needs. For us to determine the best method for improving your indoor air quality, we will first conduct comprehensive testing to see where your air is failing. Our fully trained, professional and expert technicians specialize in the installation of:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Air Knight Systems</li>
			<li>Electronic Air Cleaners</li>
			<li>REME HALO Systems</li></ul>

		<p>We’ve chosen to specialize in these particular systems because we believe they are among the best in providing clean, quality air to homeowners across Houston and Galveston. Here is a breakdown of what each system does to tackle harmful indoor air:</p>

		<p><b>Air Knight:</b> This system is designed to eliminate sick building syndrome risks by reducing odors, air pollutants, VOCs, smoke, mold, bacteria and viruses. We will mount Air Knight cells into your air conditioning and heating system ducts where most sick building problems start. Using the PHI cell advanced oxidation system, micro-organisms can be reduced by up to 99.99 percent.</p>

		<p><b>Electronic Air Cleaners:</b> An electric air cleaner captures up to 99 percent of airborne particles as they flow through your heating and air conditioning system. It virtually eliminates pollen, dust and dust mites, not to mention it helps alleviate allergies.</p>

		<p><b>REME HALO:</b> Similar to the Air Knight, this system is also designed to eliminate sick building syndrome risks by reducing odors, air pollutants, VOCs, smoke, mold, bacteria and viruses. We can easily mount this system into your air ducts, which is where many of the sick building problems originate. REME HALO works great for those who suffer from allergies and other respiratory issues.</p>

		<p>Let us help you on your way to achieving a better, fresher life at home by installing an air purification system. We can even pair these systems together to help ensure you’re breathing in nothing but clean, pure air. Call our office today to learn more about our indoor air quality solutions! </p>
